# Voltaics

This is a Minecraft mod based around creating and using power in more advanced ways. However, currently there are no ways of creating energy or using them, some of the blocks sorta store and sorta move it (this will change in the future).

Instead of having traditional multiblock structures, each block in a structure will have a different function and will be powered in different ways. If you want to use diesel fuel to generate energy, you'll have to build a diesel engine (with crankshaft and fuel injectors) and hook it up to a kinetic generator. If you want to cook some food you'll need to supply a hotbox with heat of some kind, either with a solid fuel heat generator, a gas-burning heater, induction coils, solar heaters (maybe, only if we can figure it out well enough), or just using the heat that your machines will produce. Make sure not to melt your machines or overvolt them too much, they will lose their function and will need to be repaired somehow. We'll hopefully have a series of natural gas powered machines, diesel fueled generators, steam generators, and possibly nuclear power (that needs to be harnessed somehow).
